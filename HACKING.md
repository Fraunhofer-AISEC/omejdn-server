# Commit message format

Please try to use meaningful commit messages.

Think: "Would I understand what was changed when re-reading the commit message
a few months in the future". If not, then maybe you want to be more verbose.

# Documentation

Pull Requests should aim to update the documentation alongside the code.
If you do not feel like documenting, because it would take you too long,
indicate so in your PR and someone else may be able to update the docs
before the code is merged.

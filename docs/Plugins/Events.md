# Events

These are the events that are emitted by Omejdn.
You may hook into any one of them by using

```ruby
def event_handler(bind)
    # Edit the binding context
    # E.g. using bind.local_variable_get(:var)
    # or bind.local_variable_set(:var)
end

PluginLoader.register('<desired_event>', :event_handler)
```

The event_handler will be called every time Omejdn comes across

```ruby
PluginLoader.fire('<desired_event>', binding)
```

This allows you to directly edit any values in the caller's context.

Omejdn has two types of events.
State events allow you to hook into Omejdn whenever state is to be persisted,
while Flow events allow you to directly hook into the authorization flows.

## State Events

Omejdn maintains as little persistent state as possible.
Ignoring session data and caches, which are reset with each startup,
the following diagram illustrates how data is saved by Omejdn.

Each component (in red) sends out Events to store, update, or load data.
These are then acted upon by plugins.
Default plugins are included in Omejdn's Core code
(usually in the same file as the component itself).

![Wiring diagram for State in Omejdn](omejdn_persistent_state.svg)

The default implementations for Keys
(keys and any other cryptographic material such as certificates)
and Config (all other configuration data)
persist state by writing it to disk in an easy to handle format.
The components are neither designed to be efficient,
nor to support large numbers of clients and users.
They are designed for data that does not change often,
such as the server configuration.

For this reason, if you have a larger deployment,
you might also want to re-implement the Client and User plugins,
whose default implementations are just delegating their data to dedicated configuration sections.

### Configuration Events

Configuration data is stored in `section`s, which can be read and overwritten as a whole.
Each `section`'s content can be given as either a hash or an array.
The default implementation saves each section as YAML in `/config/<section>.yml`.

- CONFIGURATION_STORE

Should overwrite a section identified by **section** with **data**.

- CONFIGURATION_LOAD

Should return the content of section **section**, or `nil` if no data is stored yet.

### Cryptographic Material Events

Keys and certificates are stored with two identifiers.
A `target_type` gives the type of entity holding the key or certificate (e.g. `omejdn`),
while the `target` specifies an identifier for that specific key or certificate (or both).
Omejdn handles key material as hashes with the keys `sk` and `pk` for the secret and public key,
`kid` for a key id, and `certs` for an array of certificates representing a certificate chain.
The default implementation saves secret keys and certificates as PEM in `/keys/<target_type>/<target>.{pem,cert}`.

- KEYS_STORE

Should store the key material **key_material** for the given **target_type** and **target**.

- KEYS_LOAD

Should return the key material for the given **target_type** and **target**.

- KEYS_LOAD_ALL

Should return an array of all key material for the given **target_type**.

### Client Events

Clients are objects in Omejdn identified by their `client_id`, which is part of their `metadata`.
They also have an attribute `backend`.
Plugins implementing these events should set the backend of returned clients to an identifier for the plugin,
and drop any events presenting them clients from other plugins, returning `nil`.
The default implementation stores clients in a dedicated config section
and defines a `target_type` for clients to store keys.

- CLIENT_GET

Should return the client identified by `client_id`, or `nil` if not found.

- CLIENT_GET_ALL

Should return an array of all stored clients.

- CLIENT_CREATE

Should store the client **client**, if the **client_backend** is correct.

- CLIENT_UPDATE

Should replace that client with **client**,
which has the same `client_id`, if it is stored by this plugin.

- CLIENT_DELETE

Should delete the client identified by **client_id**, if stored by this plugin.

#### Client Authentication Events

- CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_CERTIFICATE_GET

Should return the certificate of **client**.

- CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_CERTIFICATE_UPDATE

Should replace the certificate of **client** with **new_cert**.
A value of `nil` indicates that the certificate should be deleted.

### User Events

Users are objects in Omejdn identified by their `username`.
They also have an attribute `backend`.
Plugins implementing these events should set the backend of returned users to an identifier for the plugin,
and drop any events presenting them users from other plugins, returning `nil`.
The default implementation stores clients in a dedicated config section.

- USER_GET

Should return the user identified by **username**.

- USER_GET_ALL

Should return an array of all stored users.

- USER_CREATE

Should store the user **user**, if the **user_backend** is correct.

- USER_UPDATE

Should replace that user with **user**,
which has the same **username**, if it is stored by this plugin.

- USER_DELETE

Should delete the user identified by **username**, if stored by this plugin.

#### User Authentication Events

N.B. Avoid storing user passwords as plain text.
A function `User.string_to_pass_hash(password)` is provided to hash passwords.
Passwords can be verified against hashes using `==`.

- USER_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_CHANGE

Should replace the password of **user** with **password**.

- USER_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_VERIFY

Should return `true` if **password** is likely the **user**'s password,
and `false` otherwise.

## Flow Events

These are events which let you alter the behaviour of Omejdn significantly by adding new processing steps or even overwriting parts of Omejdn's flows.
The Token Issuing, Authorization, and Logout Flows are the internal flows started
by invoking the token, authorization, and end-session endpoints respectively.
Separate from these are the OpenID Userinfo endpoint, and various endpoints returning "static" (cachable)data.
For the latter, the plugins are typically invoked with the default response already prepared,
so you can alter directly what is returned.

### Token Issuing Flow

These events are fired during an invocation of the token endpoint.
They are listed in the order they are invoked.

- TOKEN_STARTED

Fired after the initial authentication of the **client**.
The request parameters **params** are available.

- TOKEN_UNKNOWN_GRANT_TYPE

Fired if an unknown grant type was requested
(as indicated in **params** by `params[:grant_type]`)
By default, this will cause Omejdn to return an error.

If you would like to implement your own grant types,
you should set **custom_grant_type** to `true`,
implement the grant-specific behaviour here
(including setting the **scopes** and **resources**),
and edit the tokens and responses in later events.

- TOKEN_CREATED_ID_TOKEN

Fired once the core id token is created.
You may edit the **token** directly.

- TOKEN_CREATED_ACCESS_TOKEN

Fired once the core access token is created.
You may edit the **token** directly.

- TOKEN_FINISHED

Fired upon successful issuing, before returning the **response** hash to the client.

### Authorization Flow

These events are fired during an authorization code flow
(not including the final token request, which is covered in the token flow above).
The order presented here follows loosely the order in which the events are fired.
In some circumstances, events may be fired multiple times,
e.g. when the user is changed and subsequently multiple logins take place.
The flow maintains a context hash called `auth`, which contains the request parameters and any information useful for the authorization, such as the logged in user.

- AUTHORIZATION_PAR

Fired when the optional Pushed Authorization Request endpoint is queried and the client successfully authenticates.
The request params are stored in **params** and the request URI is **uri**.

- AUTHORIZATION_STARTED

Fired when a valid authorization code flow was started.
**auth** is available, as well as the resolved request parameters **params**.
Resolved means that e.g. `request_uri`s have been resolved to the actual parameters.

- AUTHORIZATION_LOGIN_STARTED

Fired when the user has to log in.
This is usually the case when the login was requested by the client, the user was not logged in already or the user decided to switch the account.
**auth** is available.

If you want to implement other options for login, you may do so by adding a hash to the **login_options** array, containing a `:url` to a custom endpoint implementing the login as well as a `:logo` or `:desc`ription of the option to present to the user.
Call the function `login_finished` with the logged in user and an indication whether the user was just now authenticated to return to the default flow.

- AUTHORIZATION_LOGIN_FINISHED

Fired when the **user** has successfully logged in.
**auth** is available.

- AUTHORIZATION_CONSENT_STARTED

Fired when the **user** is required to give consent to some **client**.
**auth** is available.
The scope can be found in `auth[:scope]`.

- AUTHORIZATION_CONSENT_FINISHED

Fired when the **user** has given consent to a client.
**auth** is available.

- AUTHORIZATION_FINISHED

Fired when an authorization decision was made,
right before returning the **response_params** 
(including either the `code` or an `error`) to the client.
**auth** is available, but may be incomplete,
if the client was not found or the request was otherwise invalid.

### OpenID Specific Endpoints

- OPENID_USERINFO

Fired when the userinfo endpoint is invoked and authorization was successful.
The hash **userinfo** can be edited directly.

### Logout Flow

- LOGOUT_STARTED

Fired when the end-session endpoint was queried.
The **id_token**, requesting **client**, and approved **redirect_uri** are available.

- LOGOUT_FINISHED

Fired when the user was logged out,
right before redirection to **redirect_uri**.

### Static Endpoints

These events are fired whenever certain "static" endpoints are invoked.
The responses should take caching into account.
This is not the place to return rapidly changing data.

- STATIC_JWKS

Fired when the default `jwks_uri` is invoked.
The **jwks** hash can be altered directly.

- STATIC_WEBFINGER

Fired when the webfinger well-known URI is invoked.
The **webfinger** hash can be altered directly.

- STATIC_METADATA

Fired when the RFC 8414 Server Metadata well-known URI or the OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint is invoked.
The **metadata** hash can be altered directly.
After all Plugins have been called, the metadata is signed before being returned.

- STATIC_ABOUT

Fired when `/about` is invoked.
The hash **about** returns information about the server, such as version or license.

## Plugin Events

Plugins may define their own events and call them when appropriate.
These Events should follow the naming convention `PLUGIN_<pluginname>_<eventname>`, with everything capitalized.

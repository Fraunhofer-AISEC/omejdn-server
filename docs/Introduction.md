# Welcome to Omejdn!

This documentation is supposed to help you set up and use Omejdn for your purpose.
It is certainly not complete (and probably never will be),
but if you think you have something to add, feel free to issue a Pull Request.

The Documentation is loosely structured as follows:

* **Setup** helps you getting Omejdn to run in the first place
* **Configuration** describes all the configuration option that (core) Omejdn provides
* **Usage** Outlines the bare-bones interactions with Omejdn according to the OAuth and OpenID specifications
* **Plugins** contains documentation specific to certain Plugins as well as instructions to write your own Plugins
* **Integration** describes the intended interactions between Omejdn and other software, such as reverse proxies and clients
